# N.A.C.T. : Nanos Advanced Combat Tactics

NACT is a serverside package that gives combat capabilities for NPCs.
By default, the NPCs will be able to detect, flank, engage, cover, patrol and take actions against enemy players or NPCs to create interesting PvE combat situations.

While NACT is primarly focused on simulating gunfights with millitary combat tactics, we want to provide all the tools for you to create orther scenarios 
(bandits, melee, magic, fauna, etc...)
